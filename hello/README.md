# Rooftop Assessment - Question 1: Hello World

## Overview
This folder contains the solution for **Question 1** of the Rooftop Practical Assessment.  
The goal of this question is to write a program that prints `Hello, World!` to the console.

## How to Run the Scripts

All scripts are written in Python. To run a script:

1. Open terminal in the project folder.
2. Ensure Python is installed:

```bash
python --version

Run the script using
python <folder_name>/<script_name>.py

## Thought process
Created a main() function to contain the logic.

Used the standard if __name__ == "__main__": check to ensure the script runs only when executed directly.

Alternative Methods:

Could have directly used print("Hello, World!") without a function.

Chose main() to follow good practice for structured programs.
