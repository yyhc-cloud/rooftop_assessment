# Rooftop Assessment - Question 4: count_digit

## Overview
This folder contains the solution for **Question 4** of the Rooftop Practical Assessment.  
The goal of this question is to count occurrences of certain digit in a number.

## How to Run the Scripts

All scripts are written in Python. To run a script:

1. Open terminal in the project folder.
2. Ensure Python is installed:

```bash
python --version

Run the script using
python <folder_name>/<script_name>.py

## Thought process
Converted number to string and iterated characters.

Incremented counter for matches.

Used the standard if __name__ == "__main__": check to ensure the script runs only when executed directly.

Alternative Methods:

Could convert to list of digits manually using division/modulo.

Choose string method for readability and simplicity.
