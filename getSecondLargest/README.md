# Rooftop Assessment - Question 6: string_rev

## Overview
This folder contains the solution for **Question 6** of the Rooftop Practical Assessment.  
The goal of this question is to return the second largest number from an array.

## How to Run the Scripts

All scripts are written in Python. To run a script:

1. Open terminal in the project folder.
2. Ensure Python is installed:

```bash
python --version

Run the script using
python <folder_name>/<script_name>.py

## Thought process
Implemented bubble sort manually.

Removed duplicates by checking adjacent values after sort.

Used the standard if __name__ == "__main__": check to ensure the script runs only when executed directly.

Alternative Methods:

Could use set() and sorted() but restricted.

Chose manual sort for compliance and to practice loops.
