# Rooftop Assessment - Question 10: simple_stack

## Overview
This folder contains the solution for **Question 10** of the Rooftop Practical Assessment.  
The goal of this question is to simulate a stack by implementing it with push, pop, and peek using a list.

## How to Run the Scripts

All scripts are written in Python. To run a script:

1. Open terminal in the project folder.
2. Ensure Python is installed:

```bash
python --version

Run the script using
python <folder_name>/<script_name>.py

## Thought process
Used Python list as underlying storage.

Implemented push (append), pop (remove last), peek (last element).

Used the standard if __name__ == "__main__": check to ensure the script runs only when executed directly.

Alternative Methods:

Chose list for simplicity and readability in Python.
